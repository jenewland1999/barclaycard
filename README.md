# Barclaycard Challenge 2019

Our team's (winning) submission for the Barclaycard Challenge 2019 - An artwork e-commerce website utilising PHP &amp; MySQL implementing Barclaycard's payment technology.

## What is the Barclaycard Challenge?

The Barclaycard Challenge is an 2-day annual event setup by Barclaycard and The University of Northampton. During the event, 4-5 teams of 5 undergraduate final year students compete against eachother to complete a project which utilises Barclaycard's payment technology. The teams are then asked to present their project to a select few high-ranking Barclaycard employees who then pick a winner.

## What was our project?

The project given to us by Barclaycard was to create an e-commerse website utilising their payment technology in the checkout. The name of our "client" was Painting By Numbers - a small (imaginary) Northamptonshire based artwork retailer. 

## What was my contribution to the project?

For the project I took the lead roll in the brand design and front-end development utilising the skills I learnt over the past years to very speedily build the front end for the website and brand of the company. While somewhat incomplete, the work was rated very highly by Barclaycard's judging panel (which included the Deputy Head of Computing at The University of Northampton).

## Wait, weren't you a first year at the time?

Yes, I was one of a couple first year students to be chosen for the event on this year due to last-minute drop outs from others. This was the first time this had ever happened and I am the first first-year student to win the challenge, an achievement I am very proud of.
